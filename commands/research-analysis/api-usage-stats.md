GATHER API usage data from available sources:
  - API gateway or proxy logs
  - Application performance monitoring (APM) tools
  - Server access logs
  - Database query logs for API-related tables
  - Rate limiting and throttling logs
  - Authentication/authorization logs
EXTRACT key metrics for each endpoint:
  - Request count over time (hourly, daily, monthly)
  - Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
  - Error rates and status code distribution
  - Request payload sizes
  - Client identification (API keys, user agents)
  - Geographic distribution of requests
ANALYZE usage patterns:
  - Identify most and least used endpoints
  - Find endpoints with declining usage
  - Detect unusual spikes or drops in traffic
  - Calculate API adoption rates for new features
  - Identify deprecated endpoints still in use
  - Find correlation between endpoints (user journeys)
SEGMENT by client type:
  - Internal vs external API usage
  - Mobile app vs web vs third-party integrations
  - Free vs paid tier usage
  - Version adoption rates
  - Top API consumers by volume
CREATE optimization recommendations:
  - Endpoints to deprecate (low/no usage)
  - Endpoints needing performance optimization
  - Rate limiting adjustments needed
  - Caching opportunities
  - API versioning strategy updates
  - Documentation gaps based on usage patterns
GENERATE usage report including:
  - Dashboard-ready visualizations
  - Executive summary of API health
  - Detailed endpoint inventory with metrics
  - Deprecation candidates with migration paths
  - Performance optimization priorities
  - Client adoption insights
  - Cost analysis (if applicable)
