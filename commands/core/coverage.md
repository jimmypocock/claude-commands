FIRST identify and run the code coverage command for this project (e.g., npm test -- --coverage, pytest --cov, go test -cover, etc).
UNDERSTAND the code coverage percentages for each function and method in this codebase.
THEN add unit tests to functions and methods without 100% coverage.  This includes negative and edge cases.
ALWAYS use mocks for external functionality, such as web services and databases.
THEN re-run the coverage command to verify improvements, and repeat the process as necessary.
