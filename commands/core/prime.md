READ and UNDERSTAND the README.md file in the project's root folder, if it is available.  This will help you understand the project from the user's perspective.
THEN run git ls-files to understand the files in this project.
THEN READ and UNDERSTAND the PLANNING.md file in the project's root folder, if it is available.  This will give you important context about the project, and instructions on how to build and test.
THEN READ and UNDERSTAND the TASK.md file in the project's root folder, if it is available.  This will give you important context about what tasks have been accomplished, and what work is left to do.
IF making changes to the project, UPDATE the TASK.md file with each change.  This is important for context in future sessions.  ONLY UPDATE if there are actual changes to the project, not just reading files.
IF changes alter the project structure or build process, UPDATE the PLANNING.md file accordingly.
AVOID reading files in directories named external/, vendor/, node_modules/, or similar third-party directories unless specifically needed.
