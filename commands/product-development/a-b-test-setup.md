DEFINE the A/B test parameters:
  - Hypothesis to test
  - Success metrics (primary and secondary)
  - Test duration and sample size needed
  - Target audience segments
  - Traffic allocation percentage
  - Minimum detectable effect
IMPLEMENT the test infrastructure:
  - Choose or verify A/B testing framework
  - Create feature flags for variants
  - Set up random assignment logic
  - Ensure consistent user experience (sticky sessions)
  - Implement variant exposure logging
CREATE test variants:
  - Control (A): Current implementation
  - Treatment (B): New implementation
  - Ensure only one variable changes
  - Implement fallback behavior
  - Add variant identification to analytics
SET UP analytics tracking:
  - Page views and interactions
  - Conversion events
  - Revenue or value metrics
  - User engagement metrics
  - Performance metrics for each variant
  - Error rates by variant
IMPLEMENT safety checks:
  - Automated monitoring for anomalies
  - Error rate thresholds for auto-disable
  - Performance degradation limits
  - Manual kill switch
  - Gradual rollout capability
PLAN data analysis:
  - Statistical significance calculations
  - Confidence intervals
  - Segment analysis plans
  - Secondary metric impact assessment
  - Long-term effect monitoring
DOCUMENT the test:
  - Test name and ID
  - Hypothesis and success criteria
  - Implementation details
  - Start and end dates
  - Analysis plan
  - Decision criteria for winner
CREATE monitoring dashboard:
  - Real-time metrics by variant
  - Statistical significance tracker
  - Segment breakdown
  - Error and performance metrics
  - Sample size progress
